With the new year, comes a paw-some set of new charities. 
Check out our top Charities for 2020! Top 50 Pet Charities of 2020. 
This year we want to recognize 50 outstanding pet charities for their 
work in helping to improve the lives of cats, dogs, and other animals, 
along with their human caretakers. All animal charities are deserving of 
praise, of course, but these 50 charities have been recommended by our fans 
and customers and are ones we feel deserve special recognition for their 
contributions to the lives of pets & pet owners.
